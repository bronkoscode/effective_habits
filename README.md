# effective_habits
This README contains an overview of the 7 habits and the implemented functions in this app that support the cultivation of each habit.

# Be Proactive
This is the first habit and builts the basis for all following habits. My understanding is that it is not only meant to be more outgoing or to initiate more actions, but it addresses the very fact that we are responsible for our responses to things that happen to us ("response able" as the author likes to put it). The main theme for a function that supports the user in building this habit, is to enable him to say "I am what I am, because of the choices I made". The power which lies in this realisation is the fact that not what happens to us hurts us, but our response to it. To support the user in its proactivity the app gives to features/functions.

1. The circle of influence
2. The commitment reminder
3. The encounter simulator

The circle of influence is a visual tool that helps to determine whether a problem is a direct, indirect or no control problem. The commitment reminder helps to define and remind you of your commitments. The encounter simulator, helps you to formulate your response to new encounters.
